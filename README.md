## Getting Started

To get started, you will need Python installed on your local machine. This project uses several API keys and settings, which need to be configured using `.env` and `config.json` files.

Follow the instructions below to set up everything you need!

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository from GitHub and navigating to the directory:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/rocketpoweryul/DMTribeSocialPoster
$ cd stock-market-analysis
```

### 2. Setup Environment Variables

You will need a `.env` file to store your Bing API key and any other sensitive data. You can use the provided `.env.example` template:

```bash
$ cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit the `.env` file to add your Bing API key:

```dotenv
BING_API_KEY=YOUR_BING_API_KEY_HERE
```

### 3. Configure Project Settings

The project also uses a `config.json` file to customize its behavior. Use the provided `config.example.json` as a template:

```bash
$ cp config.example.json config.json
```

Edit the `config.json` file to match your specific paths and settings. Here‚Äôs an example:

```json
{
    "csv_path": "C:\\Path\\To\\Your\\DMT_WatchlistHits.csv",
    "output_path": "C:\\Path\\To\\Your\\Output\\Directory",
    "top_items_count": 3,
    "number_of_top_stocks": 10,
    "linkedin_api_endpoint": "http://localhost:11434/api/generate",
    "linkedin_model": "mistral-small",
    "table_image_width": 8,
    "table_image_height_per_row": 0.6,
    "linkedin_dpi": 300
}
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

Set up a conda environment and install all necessary dependencies:

```bash
$ conda create --name stock_analysis_env python=3.8
$ conda activate stock_analysis_env
$ conda install --file requirements.txt
```

This will create a new conda environment called `stock_analysis_env` and install the required packages specified in `requirements.txt`.

### 5. Run the Project

You are now ready to execute the script:

```bash
$ python main.py
```

This script will analyze stock data, generate LinkedIn content, and create a stock summary table image.

## Examples

### LinkedIn Post Example

Here is a sample of the kind of LinkedIn post generated by the script:

```
üåü Key Highlights Across Leading Stocks üåü

üìä $PLTR: Reported a 30% revenue increase in Q3, driven by U.S. government contracts and AI demand. The company raised its full-year revenue forecast.

üîß $FIX: Continues to secure significant contracts in the booming construction sector, contributing to steady growth.

üöì $AXON: Innovating in public safety technology with AI-enhanced tools, including body cameras.

After an incredible post-election bump, I hope you were long the US markets!
