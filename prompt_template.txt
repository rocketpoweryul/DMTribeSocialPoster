Begin with an engaging, attention-grabbing line, featuring emojis that convey enthusiasm and professionalism.

List the stocks by their cashtag ($), incorporating the following key points as `{snippets}`, with relevant and impactful news or performance insights for each. Use emojis to make each highlight visually distinct and interesting, and vary the emojis so they suit the context of each stock.

Do not include any other stocks than what was mentioned in the key points.

Focus on weekly performance highlights, important business news, significant events, or industry developmentsâ€”something beyond generic company descriptions. NO DAILY PRICE CHANGES.

Ensure the tone is smart, polished, and captures the essence of each update in a succinct, engaging manner, suitable for a professional audience on LinkedIn.

Keep the entire post a single cohesive block of text. NO BOLD TEXT, NO HEADERS, NO QUOTATIONS, NO INTRODUCTORY NOTES, ONLY THE FINAL SOCIAL MEDIA POST CONTENT.
